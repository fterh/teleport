# teleport
Telegram chat bot providing transport and traffic related data.

**Update:** I have decided to abandon this project indefinitely, both because I'm unable to access the data that I need, and also to focus on my other priorities at the moment. As it stands, this bot is perfectly capable of the singular task of returning Google Streetview imagery for a given address :) (Still a pretty apt project name.)

**Project Status:** ~In the works~ Temporarily abandoned

I'm still working on completing a minimally-viabe product before releasing it.
If you'd like to find out more (or even contribute), let me know! More hands are always appreciated.
